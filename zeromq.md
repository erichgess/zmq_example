# Notes about ZeroMQ
## General Lessons
1. The REQ/REP socket protocol requires serial and synchronous semantics.  A REQ message must be immediately followed by a REP message otherwise the client will fail.
2. This makes timeouts a problem, since a timeout means that a REQ was sent but a REP was not received so we want to move to a new state (TIMEOUT) but the socket cannot move to a new state.  As such, we must use a different mechanism to effect the time out (The Poller) and then, if we timeout, we must destroy and recreate the socket.

```rust
match requester.poll(PollEvents::POLLIN, 5000) {
    Ok(i) => {
        if i > 0 { // `i` is the number of messages waiting on the receiver queue, if 0 then the `poll` timed out
            let mut response = zmq::Message::new();
            match requester.recv(&mut response, 0) {
                Ok(_) => {
                    // Do stuff
                }
                Err(msg) => {
                    panic!("Receive Error: {}", msg);
                }
            }
        } else {
            println!("Timeout and create new connection...");
            drop(requester);
            requester = context.socket(zmq::REQ).unwrap();
            assert!(requester.connect(&addr).is_ok());
            println!("New Socket: {:?}", requester.get_identity().unwrap());
        }
    }
    Err(msg) => println!("Polling Error: {}", msg),
}
```
3. For asynchronous communication we would need a different socket type: 

4. ZeroMQ has several patterns of messaging:
- Request/Response - Clients send requests to servers and get responses.
- Pub/Sub - A publisher publishes data and subscribers get that data.
- Pipeline - A set of tasks connected through a DAG to do work
- Exclusive Pair - For connecting two threads in a process
Pub/Sub is not what we want because it is intended for decoupled logic where the publisher does not care who its subscribers are and the subscribers are not tightly coupled in state with the publisher.  For example, in our situation, it is critical that a node B gets data from node A and if it does not, then A must resend the data.  Pub/Sub is not meant for that mechanism.

Pipeline is meant for heterogenous communication not for shared state. Where each stage in the pipeline is a different system doing different work and there is a clear order.  Our system is distributed state.

For our purposes, Request/Response is what we want.

Want a fan in pattern on the server side and a 1-1 pattern on the client side.  That is, a client is talking to a specific server and only that server since each server owns a different chunk of data.

5. The docs state that working with very big messages is difficult: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Working-with-Messages ?  But my Rust code was working with 1MiB messages without any issues? "So one of the main jobs of a good language binding is to wrap this API up in classes that are easier to use.", keep my eye on the Rust binding.

6. To read from multiple sockets at once use `poll` (this would explain why it takes a slice of PollEvents).
7. Applications use multipart messages for wrapping with metadata?  https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Multipart-Messages
8. Take care of the error handling: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Handling-Errors-and-ETERM
```none
The error code is provided in errno or zmq_errno().
A descriptive error text for logging is provided by zmq_strerror().
```

```none
In C/C++, asserts can be removed entirely in optimized code, so donâ€™t make the mistake of wrapping the whole ZeroMQ call in an assert(). It looks neat; then the optimizer removes all the asserts and the calls you want to make, and your application breaks in impressive ways.
```
9. Make sure to work through how to handle interrupt signals: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Handling-Interrupt-Signals
10. Something that we'll need eventually: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Zero-Copy
11. PubSub envelopes: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Pub-Sub-Message-Envelopes Does this address the problem I noted above with PubSub?
12. https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#High-Water-Marks
```none
When your socket reaches its HWM, it will either block or drop data depending on the socket type. *PUB and ROUTER sockets will drop data* if they reach their HWM, while other socket types will block. Over the inproc transport, the sender and receiver share the same buffers, so the real HWM is the sum of the HWM set by both sides.
```
13. https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Missing-Message-Problem-Solver.  This again points to PubSub being the wrong solution, if messages are missing the solution is to start all Subs before the Pub.  Combined with Pub dropping messges with HWM is hit means PubSub is the wrong tool to use for our work.
